# Distributed Systems - Course Labs & Personal Projects

This repository began as a collection of lab assignments from my university's Distributed Systems course. Over time, my interest in distributed systems has grown, so I decided to continue expanding this repo with new personal projects, experiments, and re-implementations.

You will find both the original course labs (with my solutions) and additional projects that dive deeper into various distributed systems concepts.

## Technologies

My personal projects may use a variety of languages and tools, depending on what I want to explore at the moment. These may include:

* **Golang**
* **Python**
* **Erlang/Elixir**
* **C++**
* **Scala**

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized by course.
Each course folder contains:

* A set of **lab directories**, each with the required work and my solution.
* Additional **personal projects** that expand on distributed systems topics.

All projects are **containerized with Docker**, so dependencies are automatically handled. This makes older projects easy to run without worrying about environment setup.
