# Distributed Systems Course Labs Projects

This was only for my University Distributed Systems Course Labs.

Distributed Systems are so intriguing. So, I decided to further study the subject and work on other projects. From now on, I will upload more projects as well as the labs that were my reference.

Most of the distributed systems projects were given in Golang. So I would most likely shift to using it instead of my Python.

My personal projects would be either in Erlang/Elixir, C++, Python or Golang. For the fun of it, I may try Scala.

## Repository Structure

Each folder regroups a certain course labs. Within each of these folders, there is a list of lab folders containing the demanded work as well as my solution.

I always dockerize my work so I don't need to worry about downloading dependencies in the future when testing an old project.
