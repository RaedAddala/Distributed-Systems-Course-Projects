# INSAT TUNIS - Distributed Systems Course Labs

Algonside the course, the labs focused mostly on synchronizing between nodes using message brokers.

We develop Distributed Systems by leveraging Message Queues Brokers as a middleware for communication between nodes.

In these Labs, I used **RabbitMQ** an in-memory message queue broker and **python**. GUIs were developed with **pyQT**.
